# Arx Chip Example Repo

A couple of questions here:

1. Am I getting the address correctly?
2. Every time I ask for a signature, I get a different one. Why is that?
3. Which message should I be throwing into the validator: the hex or "some message"?
4. Why do we need to hash the message before sending it to the chip? Would it be enough to just hex it?

I use https://www.verifybitcoinmessage.com to try and validate the signature.
